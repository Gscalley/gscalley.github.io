4. According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? = 2/3, or 66.6%
5. Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?” = Fredrick P. Brooks jr.

Chapter 1:
1.	What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold. = ‘debug”  everything that’s on the bug lists

2.	What is “Bugzilla?” = a program used to compile the lists of bugs in a system and how long they’ll take to complete

3.	What is OSAF? = Open Source Applications Foundation 

4.	What is the projects name? = chandler

6.	What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs? = “scary”

8.	What did Toy refer to as a “snake?” = “important problem that we don’t have consensus on how to attack”

9.	In the software world, what does “slippage” mean? = lateness

14.	Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions? = when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them

15.	What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer? = source code allows anyone to access its inner workings

18.	Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them. = open source software  vs.  private software not accessible to everyone 

19.	Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns? = it just shows that having software open source can have benefits

What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled? = that developers should stop designing and start coding</p>
